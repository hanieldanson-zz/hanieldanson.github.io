      <h2>Overcoming and Diffusing Stereotype Threats</h2>
      <h3>An Interregional Learning Experience</h3>
      <h4>12/07/2014</hr>
        <p>For this week's Dev Bootcamp cultural blog, we've been asked to write about identity and stereotype threats and how they have affected us. I think this will be a sensitive subject for many, but perhaps more so for minorities than for someone like myself. Having said that, I have experienced stereotype threat to a lesser degree over the past four years living in Boston. 
        </p>
        <p>I am originally from Alabama, and while I don't have a strong southern accent, I did have to overcome stereotypes that some Bostonians have about southerners. Most of the people at my office are from New England, so my performance at work was probably affected early on as I felt like I had to prove myself a little more. I may have even overcompensated at times due to this perceived stereotype threat.
        </p>
        <p>The positive outcome after four years working at the same company in Boston is that most of my co-workers have softened on these stereotypes. It is also entirely possible that my perceived stereotype threat level has diminished as I have acclimated to life in Boston. The important thing that I have to remember is that I ultimately control how others view me profesionally by the work that I do over time. If I have to work a little harder to prove myself to certain people because of reasons outside of my control, I can accept that and use that as motivation to put that much more effort into my work. I can control the latter.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to the personal growth I experienced on a professional level while working in Boston, I was also able to travel to over 60 countries and experience myriad different cultures. I hope that I can use the Dev Bootcamp experience and future work experiences to diffuse any situations where someone may feel any type of stereotype threat. Having an open mind and the willingness to constructively address stereotype threats directed towards others is a huge part of that.
