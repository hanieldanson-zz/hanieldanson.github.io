      <h2>Keep It Classy</h2>
      <h3>A More Structured Approach to Objects and Methods</h3>
      <h4>11/30/2014</hr>
        <p>It's been a great week of turkey, coding, and then a little more turkey followed by even more coding. This week's Dev Bootcamp material centered around Ruby classes. From what I've learned, classes are essentially a better way to organize methods and objects beyond very basic code where they may not be necessary. To start a class, you simply need to define it with a class statement. Within that class, you can create methods for the various objects within the class. The first method that you need to focus on is the Initialize method. From my understanding, this is a basic requirement to create a proper Class that defines how you create the objects that follow.
        </p>
        <p>Below is some code I created for a very simple Powerball program that generates the random winning Powerball numbers (@powerballnumbers) and random numbers for a recently purchased Powerball card (@yournumbers). I honestly don't know any of the structure behind how Powerball numbers are called, so this is an extremely simplified exercise to demonstrate what you can do with the Class structure. I'll dive into my explanation after the code below.
        <pre class="commands">class Powerball
  def initialize
    @powerballnumbers = Array.new(6){ rand(1...100) }
    @yournumbers = Array.new(6){ rand(1...100) }
  end

  def buycard
    @yournumbers
  end

  def generate
    @powerballnumbers
  end

  def win
    if @powerballnumbers == @yournumbers
      puts "Jackpot!!!"
    else
      puts "Better luck next time!"
    end
  end
end

powerball = Powerball.new
p powerball.buycard
p powerball.generate
p powerball.win

#=>

[30, 28, 61, 21, 26, 9]
[27, 14, 25, 70, 26, 82]
Better luck next time!
        </pre>
        </p>
        <p>In the initalize method, I set up the necessary arrays that we can then use in subsequent methods. Notice that I used instance variables like @powerballnumbers so I could then use those methods in any method within the Powerball class. After creating @powerballnumbers and @yournumbers, we can create new methods that will allow us to print them out to the console with driver code. The last step is to see if you got winning Powerball numbers, which you can see I didn't get from the output at the end of the code example. Better luck next time!
