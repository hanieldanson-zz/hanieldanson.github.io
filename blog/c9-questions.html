        <p class="blog">Writing or forming a good question can be tough, especially when the question is technical. Fortunately, I have quite a few years of experience asking technical questions on forums. My hope is that this will translate into solid questions on developer websites like Stack Overflow.
        </p>
        <p class="blog">Over the years, I have usually received very helpful responses to my questions on technical forums. The biggest part of that is that I have taken the time to read forum guidelines. Most forums have very clear rules or guidelines on how to post. If you are posting a question that has been asked recently or is easily searchable, chances are that someone is going to get frustrated. That's why I always make sure there aren't previous threads that contain the answer to my question.
        </p>
        <p class="blog">It is fairly common for people to get called out on forums for asking questions that have already been answered. When I do post a technical question on a technical forum, I start by mentioning that I have searched extensively for an answer to no avail. Perhaps I didn't search for the right terms, but I want people to know that I tried to find an answer first. This seems to do the trick.
        <p class="blog">
        I also try to be as detailed as possible. Any logs, specs, or other technical information I can provide will help on multiple levels. People are way more likely to respond to my question if I am detailed and concise. It's also a time saving measure. If I can provide all of the relevant information needed to answer my question up front, my question usually gets answered much more quickly.
        </p>
        <p class="blog">I try to take the same approach if I'm asking someone for help with development questions. I have a good friend who I usually ask questions when I am completely stumped on something. The key for me is to give him as much detail up front as possible. I want him to be able to dive in and not feel like he has to ask me a ton of questions to figure out what I'm talking about. This approach has worked very well so far.
