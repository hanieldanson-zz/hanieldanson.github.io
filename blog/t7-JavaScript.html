      <h2 class="title">JavaScript Objects vs. Ruby Hashes</h2>
      <h3 class ="subtitle">Oh so Similar but Not Quite the Same</h3>
      <h4 class="date">12/15/2014</h4>
        <p class ="blog">This past week was my first foray into JavaScript after focusing on Ruby and HTML/CSS previously. It was definitely a little jarring to switch to a new language when I haven't even mastered Ruby yet. Since I come from a foreign language background, this reminds me of learning Portuguese in college and then trying to switch back to Spanish without having fully mastered Portuguese. It's not easy when you haven't mastered one of the two, but I think it ultimately trains you to be quick on your feet and flip the switch on a moment's notice.
        </p>
        <p class ="blog">One interesting thing I noticed fairly quickly while reading through <i>Eloquent Javascript</i> by Marijn Haverbeke is that JavaScript Objects looked really similar to the Ruby Hashes I had been using for several weeks in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp. The first difference I noticed was the use of var in Javascript to declare the variable name of the object. This is not necessary in Ruby as you can see below. The syntax for key value pairs inside the hash is also slightly different.

          <pre class="commands2">
<u>Ruby Hash Example:</u>
instruments = { :guitars => 47, 
:banjos => 21,
:fiddles => 17 
}


<u>JavaScript Object Example:</u>
var instruments = { guitars: 47, 
banjos: 21,
fiddles: 17
}
          </pre>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class ="blog">Another difference that I noticed is in the notation for printing out values. In Ruby, you would use puts, the hash name, and insert the key inside square brackest in order to return the value. JavaScript uses dot notation and a slightly different method to display the same thing. The method name console.log() in JavaScript is also a little more verbose than writing a simple puts method in Ruby. I added puts and console.log() to the same examples below to put things in context.

puts instruments[:banjos]

banjos: 21,

console.log(instruments.banjos)
