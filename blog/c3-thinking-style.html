      <h2>Thinking Styles and Mindsets</h2>
      <h3>Musings on Concrete Random Thinking and going all-in with a Growth Mindset</h3>
      <h4>11/16/2014</hr>
        <p>
        According to the thinking style test I took for DBC, I am  a Concrete Random Thinker, which means that I fall into the experimental bucket of thinkers. I definitely don’t fit every condition of this type of thinker, but I can see why I would lean more in this direction. Some of the key traits of a Concrete Random Thinker include: create new things or products from scratch, prefer hands-on experiences, enjoy proving that their method to solve a problem works, like self-directed learning, and are very competitive. Notice that I only listed a few of the key traits. This is mainly because these are the traits that tie me to this line of thinking style more than any other. I also don't want to bore you to death!
        </p>
        <p>
        Out of all of the key traits I mentioned above, my preference for hands-on experiences and self-directed learning will be invaluable to my learning experience at Dev Bootcamp. I can learn by listening, but when it comes to something very nuanced like programming, I need to listen and do either at the same time or in quick succession. Since lectures are a smaller part of the daily Dev Bootcamp experience, I feel like I will thrive by being able to get condensed bits of information and immediately focus on implementing whatever is being taught that day. For our final projects, my self-directed learning skills will be extremely useful when trying to figure out how to implement new concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
        My thinking style has been beneficial in some ways and detrimental in others. For example, I probably spent way too much time experimenting  with the website you are reading at this very second. The benefit is that I learned a lot of things that were probably beyond that basic HTML and CSS that we learned and I think my site looks pretty decent as well. The downside? Because I was having so much fun experimenting with the website after completing the week-2 work, I continued tweaking my website on the Sunday before week-3 and the first day of week-3 as well. I probably should have taken the opportunity to get ahead on week-3 material before continuing to tinker with the week-2 website. For me, the takeaway is that I need to focus on improving my ability to bounce from challenge to challenge without going to crazy over one topic that interests me. I can easily go back to these topics of interests once I finish my work for the week ahead of time.
        </p>

        Now, contemplate the idea of [growth vs. fixed mindset](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/). Part of knowing about your thinking styles is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we also want to encourage you to broaden the ways you learn and think. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think. The more well-rounded you are, the easier it will be to learn quickly and effectively.
