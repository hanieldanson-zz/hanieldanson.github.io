      <h2>Thinking Styles and Mindsets</h2>
      <h3>Musings on Concrete Random Thinking and going all-in with a Growth Mindset</h3>
      <h4>11/16/2014</hr>
        <p>
        According to the thinking style test I took for Dev Bootcamp prior to Phase 0, I am  a Concrete Random Thinker, which means that I fall into the experimental bucket of thinkers. I definitely don’t fit every condition of this type of thinker, but I can see why I would lean more in this direction. Some of the key traits of a Concrete Random Thinker include: create new things or products from scratch, prefer hands-on experiences, enjoy proving that their method to solve a problem works, like self-directed learning, and are very competitive. Notice that I only listed a few of the key traits. This is mainly because these are the traits that tie me to this line of thinking style more than any other. I also don't want to bore you to death!
        </p>
        <p>
        Out of all of the key traits I mentioned above, my preference for hands-on experiences and self-directed learning will be invaluable to my learning experience at Dev Bootcamp. I can learn by listening, but when it comes to something very nuanced like programming, I need to listen and do either at the same time or in quick succession. Since lectures are a smaller part of the daily Dev Bootcamp experience, I feel like I will thrive by being able to get condensed bits of information and immediately focus on implementing whatever is being taught that day. For our final projects, my self-directed learning skills will be extremely useful when trying to figure out how to implement new concepts.
        </p>

        My thinking style has been beneficial in some ways and detrimental in others. For example, I probably spent way too much time experimenting  with the website you are reading at this very second. The benefit is that I learned a lot of things that were probably beyond that basic HTML and CSS that we learned and I think my site looks pretty decent as well. The downside? Because I was having so much fun experimenting with the website after completing the week-2 work, I continued tweaking my website on the Sunday before week-3 and the first day of week-3 as well. I probably should have taken the opportunity to get ahead on week-3 material before continuing to tinker with the week-2 website. For me, the takeaway is that I need to focus on improving my ability to bounce from challenge to challenge without going to crazy over one topic that interests me. I can easily go back to these topics of interests once I finish my work for the week ahead of time.
        </p>

        Another element of the pre-Phase 0 prep was researching the differences between a growth mindset and a fixed Mindset. I thought this exercise was extremely helpful and helped me identify the strengths and weaknesses of my current mindset. My guess is that many people ebb and flow between a fixed and growth mindsets depending on the circumstances. I think this is OK, but my goal is to shift the pendulum so that the range is tightened and it swings towards growth more often than not. Deep down, I think everyone knows that the characteristics of a growth mindset are the path to success, whether you have read the differences between growth and fixed mindsets before or not. However, it’s helpful to have them down as a reminder for how I want to consistently approach living and learning through Dev Bootcamp and beyond. Everyone needs a reminder from time to time.
