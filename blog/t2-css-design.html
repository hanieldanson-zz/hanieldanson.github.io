    <h2>Classes and Ids</h2>
    <h3>A basic rundown on best practices</h3>

      <p>
        It can be very easy to get bogged down on when to use classes, ids, or when to just add styling directly to the element using CSS. For the most part, it is not considered best practice to add global styling directly to elements. This may be OK for very simple sites, but it can lead to issues as a website becomes more complex. It would also be very uncommon to see a major site with global styling directly applied to elements.

        So if it is not considered best practice to apply styling directly to elements, you're left with classes or ids for styling elements. Classes are used when you want to be able to use styling in more than one place. I used a class for my tables in order to get the formatted consistently across my page. As you can see below, this requires referencing the class right before the table in the html file.

        Ids are much more specific and are used when you only want to style a specific element. They can be a very powerful tool when used correctly. If not, they can actually make your code and styling way more complicated than it really needs to be. As a beginner, it is difficult to know if you will be use any particular styling more than once. Generally speaking, it is better to err on the side of caution and go for a class if you think you might be using it again. This will make it easier to keep your code clean and dry. This will make you happier and anyone else who has to look at your code as well. Here is an example of using ids when the styling will not be used anywhere else on the page. These ids are for profile and header images. Since there is only one profile picture and one header image, the styling won't be used again and a class is unnecessary.

        The key is to stop and think before going on autopilot and going with a class or an id. Could I potentially use this styling again? Great, I should go with a class to keep things clean. Is it something really granular that I need to apply styling to and I'll never use it again? Perfect, an id is the way to go. It can obviously get a lot more complicated than this, but this is a good basic approach to deciding between classes and ids.
