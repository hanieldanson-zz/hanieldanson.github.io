      <h2 class="title">Personal Development as a Means to Many Ends</h2>
      <h3 class ="subtitle">My Approach to Overcoming Sterotype Threat</h3>
      <h4 class="date">12/15/2014</h4>
        <p class ="blog">Personal development is the one value that really sticks out as the most relevant for my Dev Bootcamp experience. I was recently presented with the choice of continuing on my current career track or pulling a complete 180 and developing a new skilset. This is the point that Dev Bootcamp entered the equation. The opportunity to learn technical and non-technical skills that could help me pursue my dreams made Dev Bootcamp a no-brainer in my decision making process.
        </p>
        <p class="blog">On the non-technical side, being more cognizant of my values and the importance I place on those values will help me mediate stereotype threat if and when I feel it. For each of the core values that I am focusing on, personal development being one of many, I have to put every effort into living up to the standards and goals associated with those values. How do I overcome stereotype threat by being the best possible version of myself? The answer is that I will feel less overwhelmed in the face of adversity when faced with a difficult situation or problem that needs to be solved. Even more importantly, I will see it as a challenge and an opportunity to overcome stereotype threat when I encounter it.
        </p>
        <p class="blog">
        I also plan on taking full advantage of the yoga element when I enter Phase 1 of Dev Bootcamp. I have practiced yoga and meditation in the past and I think it would help to keep me on an even keel when faced with stereotype threat or any other types of challenges. From my experience, meditation and yoga can both help to rebalance your state of mind, especially in turbulent times. Recognizing that I have experienced positive outcomes from these activities is definitely an important step in re-embracing them going forward.
