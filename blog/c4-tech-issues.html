      <h2>The Mobile Payments War Is Just Beginning</h2>
      <h3>Apple Pay vs. CurrentC</h3>
      <h4>11/23/2014</hr>
        <p>It didn't take long for retailers to go all out anti-consumer following the announcement of Apple Pay. In case you haven't noticed, mobile payment terminals that would be able to accept Apple Pay have been disabled at stores like CVS and Rite-Aid. This may not matter to consumers in the long run since the mobile payments train has barely left the station. So who is to blame? A consortium of 50+ retailers called MCX and their yet to be released competitor to Apple Pay, known as CurrentC. MCX is hoping that people don't care since most people aren't quite wedded to a mobile payments system yet.
        </p>
        <p>
        The truth is that both systems have their benefits. According to Tim Cook, the primary focus of Apple Pay is solving the user experience problem for consumers rather than solving problems for corporations. Enter Apple Pay, a consumer-centric solution that focuses on the user experience rather than the bottom line. CurrentC is the exact opposite. The main reason that the MCX group forced its partners to disable mobile payment terminals is because of fees. On average, retailers pay somewhere around 2% per transaction in fees to credit card companies. This is important because CurrentC is built around a system that circumvents these fees, saving their consortium members a whole lot of money in the process. Apple Pay still maintains these credit card processing fees.
        </p>
        <p>
        Unfortunately, there are problems with both systems. Apple Pay is limited to Apple devices, so it clearly can't be a solution for all consumers. It also would have been a huge plus for businesses if Apple had found a way to circumvent credit card processing fees. CurrentC has been so focused on circumventing those fees that they forgot to consider what consumers actually want. According to a recent Hubspot blog post, only 21% of Americans have used QR codes, the technology that CurrentC is set to employ. The fact is that QR codes have been around for years and have not been adopted by the vast majority of consumers. On the bright side, there are rumblings that MCX could ditch QR for NFC. This switch has yet to materialize but hopefully MCX and CurrentC will see the light.
        </p>
        <p>
        There are a few solutions to this problem but they both involve some serious tweaking by the aforementioned parties. MCX will learn soon enough that consumers don't want to pay with QR codes, even if consumers aren't aware of that fact themselves. CurrentC has to be NFC based or it will lag behind other mobile payments systems, regardless of how much power the MCX consortium may wield. Additionally, they have to open up mobile payments to more than just CurrentC. Consumers are just going to stick with plastic if they have to worry about which mobile payment app to use every time they go in a different store. For Apple, the solution has less moving parts. They need to find a way to circumvent credit card processing fees. Solve that problem and MCX may not have so many qualms with Apple Pay.
