    <h2 class="title">Craigslist Roommates</h2>
    <h3 class="subtitle">It Doesn't Always Work Out</h3>
    <h4 class="date">12/27/2014</h4>
      <p class ="blog">A few years after I moved to Cambridge, one of my roommates had to move out on short notice. He had some unfortunate personal circumstances that made this move completely understandable. We listed our place on Craigslist and were promptly flooded with e-mails. This came as no surprise since we lived in a nice and reasonably priced apartment. A place like this is a rarity in Cambridge.
      </p>
      <p class="blog">It's almost more difficult to find a good roommate when you live in a nice but cheap apartment. We received an overwhelming amount of interest in just a few days after our Craigslist post. It's likely that we rushed through the process as a result of the e-mail onslaught. Our decision boiled down to who we thought we would enjoy hanging out with the most. Unfortunately, this didn't end up being a good gauge for the ideal roommate.
      </p>
      <p class="blog">Two weeks after the new roommate moved in, I left for a 5-week business trip to Asia. This included stops in the Russian Far East,  Japan, and South Korea. Around week 2, I received the e-mail that sent things into a tailspin. After a long day of work in Seoul, I was relaxing in my hotel when I saw it. He wanted me to call him to talk about rearranging the kitchen furniture. This would entail getting rid of some of my furniture and rearranging other pieces. I told him that this would need to wait until I returned home. 
      </p>
      <p class="blog">The whole situation confounded me because of his aggressive approach. Despite this, I asked him if we could wait to discuss things until I returned to Cambridge. This seemed like a reasonable request based on simple logistics. Unfortunately, the e-mail exchanges escalated from there. The e-mails were frequent and the time zone difference made phone calls inconvenient. He finally backed off after a week with no measurable progress.
      </p>
      <p class="blog">His impatience combined with my frustration sent the hostility levels into the stratosphere. Upon my return, there was little room for an amicable agreement. It didn't help matters that he had been looking for furniture even when he said he would wait. After a few days of arguing, he decided that he had no other option but to move out.
      </p>
      <p class="blog">I definitely could have taken a different approach in my initial e-mail response. If I could go back, I would calmly explain how I would like to discuss this issue when I returned. At some point, I should have communicated that I felt disrespected by his approach. He needed to know that I liked him as a person but he was not taking my circumstances into account. I also would have asked my other roommate to step in and cool things off earlier. There is little doubt that he would have continued sending e-mails with his demands. While I'm sure of this, I know I played a part in creating a hostile environment.
      </p>
      <p class="blog">It's tough to know how to engage with someone who isn't willing to compromise. Living with this type of person is even more challenging. Through this experience, I learned to resolve issues by taking a more conciliatory approach. When there is a complete disconnect in perspectives, this approach becomes even more crucial. I also have more clarity on the types of questions I need to ask potential roommates. When looking for a roommate, asking the right questions is just as important as first impressions.
