        <h3>Fireside Chat Musings</h3>
        <h4>If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen</h4>
        <h4>November 2, 2014</h4>
          <p>I'm glad that I'm writing this after seeing a few other people write their reactions to Shareef's video, Kitchen vs. Table, and I don't say this because I want to regurgitate what others have said. The reason I find it helpful is because I can see that every single person is coming into this with some degree of nervousness, perhaps a little doubt, but ultimately approaching the experience with enthusiasm. I have the same feelings nervousness and doubt. Fortunately, I think this is completely normal and reasonable going into an experience like Dev Bootcamp.
          </p>
          <p>We are about to embark on a pretty incredible journey and every single one of us is responsible for how much we get out of it. That is the key takeaway for me. Before watching the Fireside Chat, I had already been going back and forth between the two mindsets, Kitchen vs. Table. It was refreshing to have some of my thoughts going into Phase 0 reinforced by Shareef's talk. This gives me confidence that I am approaching this experience from the right frame of mind.
          </p>
          <p>On one end, there is a certain expectation that I will get something out of Dev Bootcamp based on the price and reputation of the organization alone, and I think that's OK to a certain extent. The problem with focusing on that is that Dev Bootcamp will only be worth what I put into it. My goal is to focus on expectations for what I can do for myself and my cohort rather than what Dev Bootcamp can do for me.In the end, Dev Bootcamp can only bring the best out of us if we are bringing the best versions of ourselves to the experience.
          </p>
          <p>All of that being said, I would be crazy if I wasn't nervous about the journey ahead, but it's a nervous excitement. I also have some of the fears mentioned by Shareef in the Fireside Chat. Like my nervousness, I aim to tackle these fears while understanding that my cohort is right there with me. I'm looking forward to meeting everyone in the Chicago cohort and tackling the many challenges that lie ahead.
