      <h2>How I Learned to Stop Coding Solo and Love to Pair</h2>
      <h3>A Recap of the Pair Programming Experience</h3>
      <h4>11/30/2014</hr>
        <p>Pair programming for the first time a few weeks ago definitely felt like an experiment. Perhaps the Phase 0 work at Dev Bootcamp is structured to feel like that since we didn't have a GPS (Guided Pairing Session) until we had already gotten a few pairing sessions under our belts. Regardless, it's something that seemed to come naturally after a few attempts. The main thing that I enjoy about pair programming is seeing how people approach the same problem in a different way. Many times I end up learning some new method or approach that I can use in subsequent challenges. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The only frustrating thing about pair programming can often end up being very rewarding in the end. Occasionally when I pair with someone, we may not get off to a fast start and end up getting stuck. Perhaps the communications lags as well and it is easy to get frustrated in that kind of situation. However, I find that my pair and I almost always find a way to get unstuck and get more synced up with eachother. For me, this is a very rewarding outcome ,even if it is frustrating to get to that point.
        </p>
        <p>
        The anonymous feedback we get about these pairing sessions has been very beneficial for me as well. We are learning a lot in a short period of time, so it's hard sometimes to really gauge where you're at comparatively. The takeaway for me, after reading through my feedback, is that any perceived weaknesses that I have with the material may not be as bad as I think they are. The most consistent thing that I see mentioned is the need to work on time-boxing and I completely agree with that assessment. I have a tendency to get zoned in until I've solved the problem with my pair and have been making more of effort to put hard stops on our sessions. The other consistent thing I see is that people really enjoy pairing with me because of my communication and the way that I think through problems. It's good to know that people enjoy working with me and hopefully I can get feedback that will allow me to improve in this area even more.
        </p>
        <p>
        Overall, I feel great about how pair programming has gone so far. I can't think of a single time where I didn't learn something from a pair session or feel like I didn't contribute in a positive way to the session. Solo programming is absolutely necessary because you need to be able to solve problems on your own, but I have learned so much from my pair programming sessions that I think I would have missed otherwise. The best part about pair programming besides learning from other people is that it is actually fun for me to break down a problem with someone else. Being able to share that sense of accomplishment after a successful pairing session is definitely a rewarding experience.
